An experienced basketball player knows from his or her guts the throw angle and the speed to make a 3-point goal from the player's position. In physics, this problem relates to the search for classical paths between two fixed points. For a moving object under gravity, if (0,0) and (x,y) are the initial and final points, we would like to find the initial elevation angle with respect to the x-axis and the travel time of a projectile whcich connects (0,0) and (x,y). If the energy E of the projectile is a constant, there can exist 2 classical paths between (0,0) and (x,y). Formally, these paths can be obtained by minimizing,
